**********READ ME FIRST!!!  ********

1- IMPORTANT
The project has been made on Visual Studio 2019. Some escape sequences 
for colors and speacial characters like heart, diamond etc, are only executable 
if you compile the code on VS. Otherwise simply black and white console 
output with vague codes hard to understan for eg 
where there should be a smiley face, you will see "/x3" .

2-Ensure that the inventory "txt.txt" 
and "product.txt" are put in the same folder as the 
.cpp and .h files. Otherwise the built-in inventory will not be accessed.

3- Compilation: 
Create Project on visual studio and add 2 .cpp files, Name one as Innventory.cpp
and other as ProjectMain.cpp . Then add 2 .h files to project and name it Innventory.h 
and ProjFunctions.h. 
Paste codes from relevant files in the provided Folder. 
Visual Studio will automatically create a Project Folder. COPY AND PASTE BOTH 
.TXT FILES IN THAT FOLDER. Product.txt and txt.txt.

For multiple selection options, enter the relevant option number:
for e.g:
1-   Order Product
2.Checkout

Press 1, then enter, to order product and 2 for checkout.

Enjoyyy  :)
